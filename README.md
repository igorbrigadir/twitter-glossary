# Twitter Glossary
A glossary of Twitter specific terminology. Prompted by this [tweet](https://twitter.com/jayholler/status/1266021381298221056) and also having to explain these to people, here are a bunch of Twitter-specific terms. I thought it might be fun to collect these - contributions welcome!
