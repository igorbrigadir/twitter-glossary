# Twitter Glossary
A glossary of Twitter specific terminology. Prompted by this [tweet](https://twitter.com/jayholler/status/1266021381298221056) and also having to explain these to people, here are a bunch of Twitter-specific terms. I thought it might be fun to collect these - contributions welcome!

Theres a glossary on Twitter, and a bunch of others aimed at marketing people but all those are boring so i might leave out / link to all the ones already defined there: https://help.twitter.com/en/glossary
